Can international students studying a master degree apply for the Software Engineer Internship?

Temika Cage       07:10 PM

Yes you can! Splunk does sponsor.

what are you most excited about working on at Splunk?

Jarlath Bloom       06:41 PM

For me - its solving Client Problems. 

Working with some of the largest clients (banks, Federal agencies, etc.) and discussing what their problems are, and crafting a solution for them that is robust and solves their problem. 

Often I hear from clients “Oh we can’t fix this, it is impossible” - and I love that word - impossible. Smashing that expectation, and finding solutions is what I love to do. Technology just enables that to happen with more frequency, and with Splunk we solve massive, critical organizational problems every day.

It's interesting that so many of you did not have a tech background when starting/going through college. What could be said about students who are currently studying CS and may be interested in branching into another field as well? (Like design or marketing)

Jeff Spencer       06:42 PM

There’s a lot of unexplored value in the novel intersection of disparate practices. I think if you have interest in design or content you should explore those areas as well. It’ll make you a better programmer and you may be able to apply that in an area that is underserved.

What do you think is the most important skill to have (in life and also as as someone early in their career)? Any tips for building this skill?

Connecting with others. This sounds simple and cliche even but if you think about it, you never win alone, there's always a team! At splunk, we work closely together to accomplish some really big goals in aggregate. I developed the skill of connecting with and understanding others as a waitress, striking up conversations with people I didn't know. In a professional context, I encourage you to ask every person you interact with for an intro to someone else. Doesn't have to be formal, could be a simple casual ask like ' hey, do you know anyone that could help me understand X better?' That might be asking if they know someone who is good at a skill you want to learn, or in an industry you're curious about, etc. I will triple stress the importance of this for after you get the job.

As a product person, I am curious about what kinds of product/tech challenges are you facing at Splunk?

Jarlath Bloom       06:44 PM

Scaling - clients want to get bigger and faster. (50TB+ a day, scaling to Petabytes a day.)

Another problem - slightly unique to Splunk I think is that you can effectively do anything with Splunk, sometimes very creative and wild things. 

Supporting those unique implementations and extending those can be difficult at times, and is a challenge. 

Its a good problem to have.

What is the typical experience as a software engieer at Splunk?

More of a Software Engineering related question - I heard that employees at Splunk have the privilege of working either on the front end or back end. But how does that usually work? If a person's interest doesn't really lie on one end, they can shift to other areas inside splunk?

I actually am a Backend Engineer that transitioned out of a front end role. We have all sorts of balances that can be done between the two

Chrystal Zou       06:56 PM

I'm the opposite :) I'm a fullstack software engineer who was on a backend-heavy team when I first joined, and I later transitioned to my current team, which is entirely frontend, and am really happy here!

Do ERGs ever work together and are there people in more than one ERG?

Temika Cage is going to answer this question live.

Jarlath Bloom       06:51 PM

I’m a member of 2! :) We’ve had intersectional events, and will continue to have some! Temika I am sure will tell you more!

How does Splunk create an environment that allows an ADHD person to thrive with their disability?

Jeff Spencer       07:00 PM

We’ve worked to reduce corporate communications and to offer more flexibility regarding working hours, workload, and facilitating asynchronous work.  While these efforts aren’t exclusively focused on ADHD, they definitely help with overwhelm. Besides treatment with medication, which should always be co-managed with a licensed provider, there’s a lot that can be done, e.g. skill building, intentional coping strategies, and healthful habits like nutrition and exercise. The literature suggests that while medication is very effective, non-medication treatments provide significant benefit even without medication.

As memebers of ERGs, have you seen the inclusions of these groups change the direction of the company as the whole? Do you think spunk’s social impact is reflective of the values of groups like these.

Temika Cage       07:12 PM

We are being impactful when it coms to the company’s culture and direction. Especially as social justice has been on the forefront. I, myself, have been on several calls with ERGs with The CEO, VPs, and the head of Diversity who spoke earlier where they were all ears about what they can do to be better

Does splunk support individualism as much as they do group collaboration

Jeff Spencer       07:04 PM

Yes, that’s part of the idea around the “one million data points” we share. There’s balance in working alone and together, and in my role I feel empowered to do the things that I think need to be done.

FAITH NWOKOMA       07:02 PM

Hi Nia, Please can you explaing how your background video app

Jeff Spencer       07:12 PM

Zoom has a “Virtual Background” feature that lets you use an image or video as a background. It uses AI to detect the background and “mask” it from being presented.

Katia Ratkovich       07:05 PM

How has Splunk created a community for interns to ensure people feel connected while virtual? Have they had the opportunity to participate in ERGs even though they are not in the office?

Daniel Glovsky (He/His)       07:08 PM

Great question! We shifted our entire company (including our intern program) to a virtual setting, complete with virtual events, learning and development courses, ERG events, and networking events. Our interns this summer actually had more exposure to our leadership team than they every had in person :)

Connor Devlin       07:05 PM

How does Splunk handle the work-life balance?

Chantalle Palomo       07:10 PM

It's manageable and you have a say in how you manage your work/life. However, we're not immune to the impact of covid-19. Like so many remote workers right now, the risk of burnout is real and I know for me I try to be mindful and let my manager know when i need to take a day to myself
